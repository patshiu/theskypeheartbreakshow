  			<p><lead>Skype Heartbreak Show is an interactive installation exploring the decay of a long-distance, romantic relationship through the filters of unreliable technology. </lead></p>
	  		<p>During the performance, the audience will witness the development of the couple's relationship, as mediated by the technologies though which the characters communicate.  The storyline is dynamic, changing according to the movement of the audience within the performance space. Members of the audience are both spectators and actors in this digital love story.</p>

	  		<p>The performance will explore the nature of glitch. Technology, like us, have the potential to act in spastic, violent, unpredictable ways. In glitch, data decays. Over enough time, the repositories of our modern lives (e-mails, instant messages, shared pictures and videos) inevitably decay into a state of legacy and incoherence. The information becomes unreliable, even for the machines that originally transmitted and cached them. Digital memory becomes no more reliable than human memory.</p>

	  		<!--<p>In terms of technology, the set-up will consist of a closed room with two projection screens in the middle. The two screens will be projected on, these represent the two parts of the relationship from a screen-based perspective (his side of a Skype call, her side of a Facebook feed, his side of a Gmail account, etc.). In front of these screens will be a Kinect, registering the movement and position of members of the audience, and a fixed tablet, through which the audience will be able to interact with the content of the piece, while every member of the audience will have, through a server connection established via their own smartphones, a way to interfere with the formal aspects of the piece.</p>-->
