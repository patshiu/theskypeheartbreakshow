  			<p><lead>Skype Heartbreak Show is an interactive installation exploring the decay of a long-distance, romantic relationship through the filters of unreliable technology. </lead></p>
	  		<p>During the performance, the audience will witness the evolving conversations happening both live and broadcasted on large screens, as motion sensors in the room will track the movement of the two partners and dynamically adjust the conversation as they physically get closer or further from each other. The ultimate outcome of that final exchange will always remain uncertain, yet inevitable.</p>
	  		<p>As an interactive installation, Skype Heartbreak Show will take advantage of the the potential of our recent technology to “glitch”, to act in spastic, violent, unpredictable ways. Members of the audience will have the possibility to interfere with both the sound and the video of the mediated representations of the performers. The repositories of our modern relationships (e-mails, instant messages, shared pictures and videos) will slowly be tampered with by the public and lose objectivity in the most subjective of all contexts, exposing technology for what it should remain – a medium and not an end.</p>
	  		<!--<p>In terms of technology, the set-up will consist of a closed room with two projection screens in the middle. The two screens will be projected on, these represent the two parts of the relationship from a screen-based perspective (his side of a Skype call, her side of a Facebook feed, his side of a Gmail account, etc.). In front of these screens will be a Kinect, registering the movement and position of members of the audience, and a fixed tablet, through which the audience will be able to interact with the content of the piece, while every member of the audience will have, through a server connection established via their own smartphones, a way to interfere with the formal aspects of the piece.</p>-->
