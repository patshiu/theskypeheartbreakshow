					<li class="girl"> Yeah. And then the other day we went out with some guys from the office, and ROOMMATE joined us. It got super late and everybody left but he had his bike so i sat on the handlebars and we did'nt crash! *she sounds super excited*</li>

					<li class="boy"> It's only been a week so far, but I think she likes it. She never was really concerned about whether she was going to like it or not, you know.</li>
					<li class="girl"> Yeah, maybe.</li>
					<li class="boy"> She really isn't the kind of person to worry about work. She'd rather do stuff in her free-time, I love that.</li>
					<li class="girl"> Yeah, she's like that. I'm glad you guys keep each other company.
